# semaphoreui_project_integration_matcher (Resource)

The project integration matcher resource allows you to manage matchers for webhook integrations. Matchers define conditions that must be met for an integration to trigger a template execution.

Matchers can inspect the HTTP request body or headers and compare values using different methods (equals, not equals, contains). Multiple matchers on an integration are evaluated with AND logic - all matchers must pass for the integration to trigger.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "semaphoreui_project_integration" "webhook" {
  project_id  = semaphoreui_project.project.id
  name        = "GitHub Webhook"
  template_id = semaphoreui_project_template.deploy.id
}

# Match on a JSON body field
resource "semaphoreui_project_integration_matcher" "push_event" {
  project_id     = semaphoreui_project.project.id
  integration_id = semaphoreui_project_integration.webhook.id
  name           = "Push Event Only"
  match_type     = "body"
  method         = "equals"
  body_data_type = "json"
  key            = "$.action"
  value          = "push"
}

# Match on a header value
resource "semaphoreui_project_integration_matcher" "github_event" {
  project_id     = semaphoreui_project.project.id
  integration_id = semaphoreui_project_integration.webhook.id
  name           = "GitHub Event Header"
  match_type     = "header"
  method         = "equals"
  body_data_type = "string"
  key            = "X-GitHub-Event"
  value          = "push"
}

# Match using contains
resource "semaphoreui_project_integration_matcher" "main_branch" {
  project_id     = semaphoreui_project.project.id
  integration_id = semaphoreui_project_integration.webhook.id
  name           = "Main Branch"
  match_type     = "body"
  method         = "contains"
  body_data_type = "json"
  key            = "$.ref"
  value          = "main"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `body_data_type` (String) The data type of the body. Valid values are `json`, `xml`, or `string`.
- `integration_id` (Number) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The integration ID that this matcher belongs to.
- `key` (String) The key to match against. For JSON bodies, use JSONPath syntax (e.g., `$.field.name`). For headers, use the header name.
- `match_type` (String) Where to look for the value. Valid values are `body` or `header`.
- `method` (String) The comparison method. Valid values are `equals`, `unequals`, or `contains`.
- `name` (String) The display name of the matcher.
- `project_id` (Number) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The project ID that the integration belongs to.
- `value` (String) The value to match against.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The matcher ID.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import ID is specified by the string "project/{project_id}/integration/{integration_id}/matcher/{matcher_id}".
# - {project_id} is the ID of the project in SemaphoreUI.
# - {integration_id} is the ID of the integration in SemaphoreUI.
# - {matcher_id} is the ID of the matcher in SemaphoreUI.
terraform import semaphoreui_project_integration_matcher.example project/1/integration/2/matcher/3
```
Or using `import {}` block in the configuration file:
```hcl
import {
  to = semaphoreui_project_integration_matcher.example
  id = "project/1/integration/2/matcher/3"
}
```
